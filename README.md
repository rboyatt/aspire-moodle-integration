# Talis Reading List integrations with Moodle

This repository contains three integrations between Moodle and Talis Aspire. A description of each follows to help you choose the right one for you.

There are individual README files for each plugin which contain installation and other useful instructions.


## 2.x-activity-module

This is an activity module which is essentially a wrapper for our [Talis Reading List LTI Tool](http://knowledge.talis.com/articles/tarl-lti/).

Users will be able to select and emebed lists (or sections of lists) in their moodle courses. Lists and sections can be either displayed in-line or can be shown in embedded pages within Moodle.

This module is being actively maintained by Talis (and you are welcome to submit your own pull requests!)
