# Talis Reading List integrations with Moodle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration)

This repository contains three integrations between Moodle and Talis Aspire. A description of each follows to help you choose the right one for you.

There are individual README files for each plugin which contain installation and other useful instructions.

## Moodle 3.x

Please use the 2.x activity module named below. The activity module has been tested with all current versions of Moodle. [See the full matrix of versions tested](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration).

## 2.x-activity-module 

This is an activity module which is essentially a wrapper for our [Talis Reading List LTI Tool](http://knowledge.talis.com/articles/tarl-lti/).

Users will be able to select and emebed lists (or sections of lists) in their moodle courses. Lists and sections can be either displayed in-line or can be shown in embedded pages within Moodle.

This module is being actively maintained by Talis (and you are welcome to submit your own pull requests!)

This module is tested against all current versions of Moodle. [See the full matrix of versions tested](https://travis-ci.org/talis/aspire-moodle-integration).
